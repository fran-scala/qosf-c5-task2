# qosf cohort 5

Hi!
Once again, thank you for your interest in the QC Mentorship program!
We decided to select participants based on how they will manage to do some simple “screening tasks”
These tasks have been designed to:
- find out if you have the skills necessary to succeed in our program.
- be doable with basic QC knowledge - nothing should be too hard for you to quickly learn. - allow you to learn some interesting concepts of QC.
- give you some choices depending on your interests.
What we mean by skills is not knowledge and expertise in QC. It’s the ability to code, learn new concepts and to meet deadlines.
What are we looking for in these applications?
- Coding skills – clear, readable, well-structured code
- Communication – well-described results, easy to understand, tidy.
- Reliability – submitted on time, all the points from the task description are met
- Research skills – asking good questions and answering them methodically
Also, feel free to be creative – once you finish the basic version of the task, you can expand it. Bonus questions provide just some ideas on how to expand a given topic.
Choose tasks based on your interests, don’t try to pick the easiest one.
You need to do only 1 task. Feel free to do all of them, it might be a good learning opportunity, but it won’t affect admissions to the program :)
